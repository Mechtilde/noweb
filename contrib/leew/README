Lee Wittenberg has kindly provided his port of noweb to DOS, which
includes executable binaries.  It once appeared in the DOS
subdirectory of the standard noweb distribution, but it got superseded
by somebody else's port later on.

nocond is a slick noweb filter that supports conditional code in a
nicer way than ugly old #ifdef's.

nobrace looks for unbalanced braces in code chunks.

pretty-comment uses LaTeX to typeset inline comments...
and it's written in SNOBOL!

pretty-comment.nw is a reworking of pretty-comment, in awk and Noweb.

2col-defn-hack.tex is a LaTeX hack that prints chunk identifier lists
in 2 columns
